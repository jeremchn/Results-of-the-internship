# Results of the Internship

We possess 89 genomes of the plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. For each of these genomes, we have the transposable elements (TEs) and 69 associated features. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the superfamily and predict the methylation level of the TEs using all the available features
